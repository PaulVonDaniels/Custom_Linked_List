LinkedList
A C++ implementation of a singly linked list with basic and advanced operations like push, pop, insert, erase, and reverse. Demonstrates OOP, pointers, and data structures.

Singly Linked List in C++
This is a simple implementation of a singly linked list in C++. The project demonstrates basic knowledge of C++, including pointers, dynamic memory management, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and data structures.

Features
Basic Operations:

push_back
: Add an element to the end of the list.
push_front
: Add an element to the beginning of the list.
pop_back
: Remove the last element.
pop_front
: Remove the first element.
find
: Search for an element in the list.
remove
: Remove an element by value.
clear
: Clear the entire list.
getSize
: Get the size of the list.
isEmpty
: Check if the list is empty.
print
: Print the list.
Advanced Operations:

at
: Access an element by index.
insert
: Insert an element at a specific index.
erase
: Remove an element at a specific index.
reverse
: Reverse the list.
Error Handling:

Uses 
std::out_of_range
 for invalid operations (e.g., accessing an out-of-bounds index).
Code Structure
Node
 Struct: Represents a node in the linked list.
LinkedList
 Class: Implements the singly linked list with all the operations.
main()
 Function: Demonstrates the usage of the 
LinkedList
 class.
